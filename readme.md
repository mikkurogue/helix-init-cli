# hx-init

After trying Helix Editor, and having 3 devices I decided its probably time to create a CLI tool that will give me the same config I prefer across all my devices. LSP's etc I am not yet sure if I want to support those with specific commands.

# Supported commands

Just simply run `hxi` and a config will be created for you
